I need to separate the folder name from the data.

I upload the Amazon data into the program.
	The program stores the data into the database.
	The program creates the new folder using the product's name?? or not create until the ID has been added to the program.
add a review text area, with edit and save buttons that only manages the review text area.
review area stores data in word, reads data from word, and modifies data from word.
review area only works after the product folder has been created(needs product ID)
add a barcode field.
make the search field to look up the data from each product rather than just the name so I can use the barcode (evaluate for efficiency and need for that program's section)
import pictures function, selects a folder and copies all the pictures into the program.


So, to work next, what can be done pre ID?
can I import inventory excel file so the program gets the data and stores it in the database and creates all the folders?
